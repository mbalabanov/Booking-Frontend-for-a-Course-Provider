# Frontend for Booking Courses
This is an SPA frontend to book courses. You will need a separate JSON server to get the courses data. A mailserver like Elastic Mail can be used to send users a confirmation for their course booking. All other display-related adaptations are done in the frontend (e.g. check if a course is in the past, or if it still has room for a booking).
