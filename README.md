# Frontend for Booking Courses
This is an SPA frontend to book courses. You will need a separate JSON server to try it. If you are willing to wait and reload the page a couple of times, then you can try this production fronted that uses a free Heroku dyno (and therefore needs half a minute to spin up): https://mbalabanov.github.io/Booking-Frontend-for-a-Course-Provider/

This frontend uses Heroku for the courses API to get the courses data, all other display-related adaptations are done in the frontend (e.g. check if a course is in the past, or if it still has room for a booking).
